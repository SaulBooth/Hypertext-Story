            You decide to follow the strange man as you both run through many winding paths and after a while you start to hear sound of screaming and explosions with faints electronic high pitched sreaming which you cannot make out quite what they are saying and as you continue running you can hear they are catching up and you can now hear what they are saying "Exterminate!" You now know what they are... Daleks! Soon both of you reach a strange blue box and you immediately know who this man is and what the box is. The man was the legendary timelord, The Doctor and his tardis with a faulty chameleon circuit. You both enter the box and set off away from the crumbling station as The Doctor turns to you with a grim look on his face and says "Tell the Time Lords; war is coming."
