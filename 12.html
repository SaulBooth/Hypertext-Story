           You imediately dash outside of your room and down the hallway and turn around a corner then come to a dead stop where you see the one thing you did not want to see: a Dalek! It immediately recognises your presence and turns around and Screams "Exterminate!" at you. you see a bright blue beam fly at you as you come to the exceptance that this is your end.
